I am currently a full-time research assistant in [Prof. B.T. Thomas Yeo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BOUzsU8AAAAJ)’s [lab](https://sites.google.com/view/yeolab) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research focuses on developing interpretable and trustworthy models, particularly in medical and healthcare contexts. These models—whether computational or machine learning-based—are designed to reflect physical reality and provide insights that are understandable to humans.

I hold a Double Degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with [Prof. B.T. Thomas Yeo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BOUzsU8AAAAJ) to use machine learning to accelerate a computational model of human brains. Additionally, I worked with [Prof. Brian Y. Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_bza0AoAAAAJ) to align AI predictions with user-defined rules and provide corresponding explanations.
