        "• Containerized our fMRI preprocessing pipeline with Docker and Singularity for cross-platform consistency.",
        "• Developed an automated tool that generates intuitive MRI reports, helping patients compare their brain condition to others of the same age (expected to be used in a large hospital serving millions annually)",
        "• Maintaining the website and server of XNAT, the platform that manages and stores our MRI imaging data."

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
