WottleNFT, a student-initiated startup, is a Cardano NFT marketplace. It serves as a platform for collectors of NFTs on the Cardano blockchain to trade their NFTs efficiently and with low transaction costs. It also boasts an easy-to-use NFT minting page, where users may mint their very own NFT on the Cardano blockchain straight from the browser.

Importantly, the core of WottleNFT’s marketplace is its focus on supporting humanitarian efforts. Every trade on the WottleNFT marketplace will contribute towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - when a user chooses to list his/her NFT on the marketplace, he/she will be prompted to select a UN SDG to support. Currently, users may choose between 3 SDGs to support: Zero Hunger, Climate Action or Quality Education. When the listed NFT is successfully sold, 1% of the transaction will be donated towards the selected UN SDG. That way, the popularity of NFTs can be harnessed to do good, in the form of raising money for meaningful causes.
