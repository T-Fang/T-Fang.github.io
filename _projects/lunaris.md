Lunaris is a sleek and intuitive iOS client for the NUS LumiNUS platform, developed in Swift. The app packages various important features including module information browsing, file downloading and management, a built-in task management system, and seamless access to announcements and conferencing tools.

The current LumiNUS system creates a frustrating user experience for students, especially when managing newly uploaded files across multiple modules. Students must manually check each module, use the “show all files not downloaded” feature, and wait for the download queue to process. This process is time-consuming and error-prone—refreshing the webpage prematurely can result in the loss of newly flagged files, forcing users to manually search through the file tab to identify what is new.

Additionally, while LumiNUS highlights upcoming quizzes, assignments, and recent announcements, it lacks an integrated task management system. Students cannot easily prioritize tasks, assign tags, set expected completion times, or add personal tasks and preparatory steps not explicitly mentioned in the platform. This limitation hampers effective planning and organization.

With Lunaris, we aim to provide a superior user experience for LumiNUS users on iOS devices, particularly iPhones. Our goals include:

- Delivering a visually appealing and intuitive interface that adheres to Apple’s SwiftUI design principles.
- Enhancing file downloading and management to eliminate frustrations with the current system.
- Introducing a versatile task management system with features such as task ranking, tagging, and deadline tracking, empowering students to better manage their academic responsibilities.

By addressing these pain points, Lunaris seeks to redefine how NUS students interact with LumiNUS on mobile devices.
